# Code Generation Instructions for eRegulations MCP Server

* **MCP Compliance**: Follow the Model Context Protocol specification for standardized LLM-to-API communication. Include comprehensive tool descriptions and schemas that help LLMs utilize the eRegulations API effectively.

* **TypeScript & Architecture**: Use strict TypeScript typing with ES modules and async/await patterns. Maintain separation between MCP server layer and underlying eRegulations API service layer.

* **Data Handling**: Transform API responses into consistent, LLM-friendly formats. Handle variations in API structure gracefully with proper normalization and error handling.

* **Performance**: Implement appropriate caching with reasonable TTLs. Format procedure and step data efficiently for LLM consumption, optimizing for response times under 10 seconds.

* **Transport Support**: Ensure code works with both Standard I/O and HTTP/SSE transport mechanisms for different deployment scenarios (standalone, server, container).

* **Git**: Use conventional commits
